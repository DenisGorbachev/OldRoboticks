Hello there!

As you already know, this Roboticks thing is a simulation of a real conflict. So you'd better log in to the server and create yourself a tutorial realm.

rk host roboticks.faster-than-wind.ru	# Setup the server name
rk register YourNicknameHere		# Register new account
rk login YourNickNameHere		# Log in
rk realm:create -c TutorialRealmController YourNicknameHere_Tutorial # Create a tutorial realm
realm YourRealmID			# Select the newly created realm (YourRealmID is available in the output of previous command)

The first robot (the precursor of an army!) is already assembled. To select it, you should first get its ID.

robot YourRobotID

Now that you're all set up, it's time to learn the most important thing: how to *fire at enemies*. Real examples are far more superior than any theoretical explanations, so:

rk fire 9,9 A

Wonder what you've just did? YOU HIT THAT OTHER ROBOT. Hear that? It's been damaged and can't function. Which also means it can't fire back at us. Yummy.

Actually, there are some intercontinental rules about warning shots and the like, but that's full-scale WAR, period. We're not here for mere WARNINGS.

Okay, you've got your first target. But I reckon there are more enemies in this area. To scan the surroundings and reveal those unworthy rascals, issue the following command:

rk report

See? There's the robot you already hit, and there are other robots marked as "enemy". And hey, look, it's pretty interesting: there's a second "own" robot! We'll talk about controlling multiple robots later.
